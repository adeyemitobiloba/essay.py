essay="good day ladies and gentle men,panel of judges,accurate time keepers,codebaters and my fellow audience.My name is adeyemi tobiloba,i am here to support the motion that says the new anthem is awesome. As you know our president MR Bola Ahmed Tinubu is an old man,you should respect the fact that he is not just an old man as a president but a man that is old in ruling,controlling rightly,and making things better for the people he is ruling.President Bola Ahmed Tinubu is a man known to have ruled lagos state,the state known as the centre of excellence.But in case you don`t know, i am here to inform you that this man you my fellow citizens are insulting was the one who made the state what is it today.So while you guys are saying that he spoilt everything,i will keep on saying ride on Baba mi,because i, myself and i have never seen a nation,person,or let me even say a state become better without passing through bad stages.Now the fact that he changed the new anthem to an old one means a lot,like i mean a lot.Now take a look at the words of the new anthem, Nigeria we hail thee, our own dear native land,that is reminding us that we nigeria is our land and anything that happens will be our cause,so in case you are wandering why i only said the first two line of the anthem, i just want you to know that even the intro is enough to change the mindset of we citizens that president Ahmed did not chose this anthem just like that but for a reason in particular,so i am using this medium to tell you my fellow citizen to embrace our new anthem because it will make an impact on our nation,Nigeria.Also,the 3rd standard of our new anthem call we citizen to draw closer to God.So with these few point of mine,i wish i have being able to convince you and make it clear to my fellow Nigerians that the new anthem is a step forward but not a step backward.Thank you."
